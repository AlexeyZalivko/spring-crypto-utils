== release 1.1.1 - 2 Feb 2012 ==

  * spring crypto utils is in [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/spring-crypto-utils/spring-crypto-utils/ maven central], so there's no extra repository to setup in the pom. If you had previously setup our custom repository, you can safely remove it from your poms now as all previous versions have also been uploaded to central. There are no source code changes in this release.

== release 1.1.0 - 29 Jan 2012 ==

  * issue 5: non-existant alias name should throw an error
  * issue 3: add crypt:secretKey element
  * added support for mac (message authentication codes). See MessageAuthenticationCodeDigests.

== release 1.0.1 - 25 Jan 2012 ==

  * issue 4: added support for configuring a keystore using conventional java system properties `javax.net.ssl.keyStore` and `javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword` throgh the `<crypt:defaultKeystore/>` configuration element. See _Default Keystore_ in KeyStoreConfiguration.

== release 1.0.0 - 15 Sep 2011 ==
